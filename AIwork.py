Information about the project : Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (abbreviation: ETH[a]) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. Among cryptocurrencies, ether is second only to bitcoin in market capitalization.[2][3] It is open-source software.

Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin.[4] Other founders include Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio, and Joseph Lubin.[5] In 2014, development work began and was crowdfunded, and the network went live on 30 July 2015.[6] Ethereum allows anyone to deploy decentralized applications onto it, which anyone can then use.[7] Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications provide financial instruments that do not directly rely on financial intermediaries like brokerages, exchanges, or banks. This facilitates borrowing against cryptocurrency holdings or lending them out for interest.[8][9] Ethereum allows users to create fungible (e.g. ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with a variety of properties, and to create smart contracts that can receive, hold, and send those assets in accordance with the contract's immutable code and a transaction's input data.""")
